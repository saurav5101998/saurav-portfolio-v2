## Approach

My approach to web development involves thorough planning and strategy, continuous development with progress updates, and final development and launch. I collaborate closely with clients to map out goals and key functionalities, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.

### Planning & Strategy
We'll collaborate to map out your website's goals, target audience, and key functionalities. We'll discuss things like site structure, navigation, and content requirements.

### Development & Progress Update
Once we agree on the plan, I cue my lofi playlist and dive into coding. From initial sketches to polished code, I keep you updated every step of the way.

### Development & Launch
This is where the magic happens! Based on the approved design, I'll translate everything into functional code, building your website from the ground up.
